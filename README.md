# quartermaster-signalk-plugin
Signal K Node server plugin to report the vessel's GPS location to Quartermaster.

To work, you will need a paid Quartermaster subscription at https://quartermaster.me. A yacht Key is required for
the plugin to work. The key can be found in the Tracking section on the Quartermaster web app. Once the Key has been entered in the Signal K's plugin configuration, the plugin will send your GPS location to Quartermaster and you will be able to use Quartermaster to track your yacht's position.
